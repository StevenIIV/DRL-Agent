Naive DQN & Double DQN & Dueling DQN & A2C 
This project mainly used to compare the performance of DQN-based algorithm and A2C algorithm in several games, include ['CartPole-v0', 'LunarLander-v2', 'Breakout-v0', 'CarRacing-v0', 'Pendulum-v0'] 

I will add the result score curve diagram and how to run it in the later time (After I get a job ðŸ¤£ )
